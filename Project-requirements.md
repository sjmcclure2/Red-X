Project 2 Requirements: React + Express Full-stack Application
Overview:

    Using Agile practices you will construct a full-stack application that persists data.
    Teams come up with their own problem space and application ideas on day 1 of the project.
    The team app ideas must be approved before you start working by an instructor.

Team requirements:

    Each team member contributes to the development of a SPA that requires full-stack CRUD functionality
    Daily internal ceremonies to make sure your team is operating smoothly:
        At least a daily stand up OR stand down
    Other ceremonies you will need:

        Estimation

        Use Git feature/branch workflow as your team collaborates on the application.
