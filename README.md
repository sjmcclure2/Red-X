## Introduction
This will describe what Red-X is, and our idea behind what we created.

## Description
A more detailed outline of the project. What does it do? Is there a high level list of features? If describing a project that has visual features, consider adding pictures or animations of the features and functionality in this section. (Screen captures.)

## Installation
How can another developer get your project up and running on their own? What dependencies are required? Are there environmental requirements? Be specific, and outline steps to take in order to get the project running.
```
npm install the code
```
Or `inline` the code.

## Contributing
We should add here that we used, aka projects/repo owners from Platform One as our source of data.
