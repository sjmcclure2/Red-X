## Introduction
Red-X is a program inspired to bring together U.S. Air Force and Space Force personnel intelligence on all on-going projects and requests into one space. We are dedicated to creating a one-stop shop flow of information on if an issue in the force has an innovative team backing it, and if not, putting that request out for a team to start today.

## Description
A more detailed outline of the project. What does it do? Is there a high level list of features? If describing a project that has visual features, consider adding pictures or animations of the features and functionality in this section. (Screen captures.)

## Installation
How can another developer get your project up and running on their own? What dependencies are required? Are there environmental requirements? Be specific, and outline steps to take in order to get the project running.
```
npm install the code
```
Or `inline` the code.

## Contributing
We should add here that we used, aka projects/repo owners from Platform One as our source of data.
